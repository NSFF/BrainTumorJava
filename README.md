# BrainTumorJava
This project was a 1 week Burst project in Java, where we had to use online packages for a project by choice in Java. In this project I made a Neural network model to detect Brain Tumors. I made use of the DL4J package. This project was made in 2021. 

In this project a Dataset of Brain Tumors was used. You can find this data here: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/nsff591/rearranged-brain-tumor-dataset-from-ahmed-hamada
